Thanks for downloading StarRevenge4: The Kedama Takeover 64

This is a SM64 Hack by BroDute!

This hack has 96 stars to find. There is no star select screen for any course, but
if you cannot find stars or are not very sure about the stars you have, then look in
the stars.txt, there is every star + name.
You can look how many stars you have just by pressing START in a level or on the Overwordl (Peach's Castle).

Story: While Mario was on holidays with Peach stange white creatures called Kedamas (°A°) are trying
to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and they are stealing the stars from Peach's castle.

So, you may ask, WHY are there 3 more zip files? Well a strange bug keept me away to
place the cap switches in the game, so I made 3 extra Rom with the switches. You just open them,
press the switch and continue on the main game. The password for the zips are in the game where
the switches were originally planed.

If you are good at ASM and can fix that bug for me in the RAM, then send me the fixed version so I
can cange everything :3

For more informations ask the Toad at the beginning!
