This is a different Version of SR6 LA. You can find 70 stars in it. All stars in the main courses
have a word long name and are hidden like most of the green stars in Mario Galaxy 2.
All levels are changed in some way to let them look different.
There are no cap levels or even caps in this hack.
There are 5 overworld stars (one you will only get for 69 stars).
You need to beat SR6 with 120 stars to play this hack, since there levels are a bit harder and if you know the
layout of the levels it will be a bit easyer to find stuff.

Note: There are some invi walls near the tower in course 8!

This hack has only the first 9 main courses and the 3 Bowser levels. The 3 bosses are also different now.
