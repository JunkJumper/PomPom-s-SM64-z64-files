--------SM64 Multiplayer 1.2, created by Skelux--------
If you downloaded the PPF, this patch must be applied to an original Super Mario 64 (U) ROM using PPF-O-MATIC 3.0.
Under 'ISO File' you will need to change the file type to 'all files' and select the Super Mario 64 ROM.

If you wish to play online, it is recommended to use the emulator included. You will first need to go 
into "Options" then "Settings" and change the ROM directory to where the SM64 Multiplayer ROM is located. 
To play online, click on "File" then "Start Netplay...", enter your name, then click "Master Servers List".
Join any server and right-click below the chat window to host a game that your friend can join.

To set up the controls, go into "Options" then "Configure Controller Plugin..." and go to the "Player 2" tab.
While playing the game, you can hold 'R' to lock the camera onto your player. Also, since PJ64k does
not save while playing online, you can press 'Z' at the file select screen to unlock all levels.

Player 3 & 4 are able to interact with the objects Player 1 & 2 were last standing on respectively.
They can do this be pressing the D-Pad buttons.
