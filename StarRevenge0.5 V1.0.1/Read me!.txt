Thanks for downloading this SM64 ROM hack "Star Revenge 0.5" v1.0.1
This was made by BroDute and the original game by Nintendo.

You can find 65 stars and 7 main courses.
The main and cap levels in this hack are all based of unused
levels that were still on my pc left.

The hack is easy to normal hold and works like the normal SM64.

Note: There are sometimes bugs with the music like after getting a 100 coins star in the desert. If
really every sound disappers - even the soundeffects - you should reload the hack!

v1.0.1 changes:
-Fixed the World 1 death trap so there is no more death trap.
-Fixed the wrong warp in the first floor of the castle.
-Made a new power meter ^^

- Have fun

(Give feedback if you want just don't let it be to flat like: "Bad hack, didn't liked any level" or "Great hack, do something lika that again"
It is alsways nice to hear such stuff, but if you don't tell me what you like or hate, I cannot do something about/ against that and just continue on.)

2nd Note: There is only a german version, since the original was also in german.
